# Speech Emotion Recognition

The aim of this section is to explore speech emotion recognition techniques from an audio file.

## Data

The data set used for training is the *Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song*. **RAVDESS** contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XA48aC17Q1J
