# Facial Emotion Recognition

The aim of this section is to explore facial emotion recognition techniques from a live webcam video stream.

## Data

The data set used for training is the **Kaggle FER2013** emotion recognition data set : https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

## Requirements

```
Python : 3.6.5
Tensorflow : 1.10.1
Keras : 2.2.2
Numpy : 1.15.4
OpenCV : 4.0.0
```


## Files

The different files that can be found in this repo :
- `Notebook_Images` : A set of pictures saved from the notebooks for the final report
- `Test_Images` : A set of pictures used to test the pipeline of image treatment
- `Model_Images` : Models structures saved using `plot_model`
- `Resources` : Some resources that have to used to build the notebooks
- `Other_Notebooks` : Notebooks that have been created but were not used in the final version
- `Emoji` : A group of Emojis used to display the emotion in the live prediction version
- `emotionaldan` : A folder dedicated to Deep Alignment Network 
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` : Pre-trained Frontal Face Detection Algorithm

We'll now cover into more details what each notebook contains :
- `00-Fer2013.ipynb` : Gathers all the work

## Performance

The set of emotions we are trying to predict are the following :
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Fear
- Disgust
- Surprise
- Neutral
- Anger

The models have been trained on Google Colab using free GPUs.

# Live prediction

Since the input data is centered around the face, making a live prediction requires :
- identifying the faces
- then, for each face :
  - zoom on it
  - apply grayscale
  - reduce dimension to match input data

The face identification is done using a pre-trained Histogram of Oriented Gradients model. For further information, check the following article :
https://maelfabien.github.io/tutorials/face-detection/#b-the-integral-image

The treatment of the image is done through OpenCV

*1. Read the initial image*

*2. Apply gray filter and find faces*

*3. Zoom and rescale each image*
